            Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and
            composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film.
            He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film
            industry's most important figures. His career spanned more than 75 years, from his childhood in the
            Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both accolade and controversy.

            Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His father was absent and his mother
            struggled financially – he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother
            was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later
            working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took him to the
            United States. He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He
            soon introduced and adopted the Tramp as his screen persona. He directed his own films and continued to hone
            his craft as he moved to Essanay Studios, where the Tramp persona was developed emotionally in The Tramp
            (1915). He then attracted a large fanbase and demanded more money as he moved to Mutual and First National
            corporations. By 1918, he was one of the world's best-paid and best-known figures.

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <h3>1889–1913: early years</h3>
        <h3>Background and childhood hardship</h3>
        <p>Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr.
            His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people.[1][2][3][4] There is no
            official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South
            London.[5][a] His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal
            guardian of Hannah's first son, Sydney John Hill.[9][b] At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were
            both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker,[10] had a brief and unsuccessful career
            under the stage name Lily Harley,[11] while Charles Sr., a butcher's son,[12] was a popular singer.[13]</p>

            alt="Charliechaplin2">
        <p>Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic
            of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson.[17]
            Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington.
        </p>
        <p>In September 1898, Hannah was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum; she had developed psychosis seemingly
            brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition.[22] For the two months she was there, Chaplin and
            his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew.[23] Charles Sr.
            was by then severely alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society
            for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.[24] Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from
            cirrhosis of the liver.[25]</p>

        <h3>1914–1917: entering films</h3>
        <h3>Keystone</h3>
        <p>Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A
            representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone
            Studios who intended to leave.[62] Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies "a crude mélange of rough and
            rumble", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: "Besides, it would mean a new life.</p>

            alt="charliechaplin3">
        <p>Chaplin's boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young.[68]
            He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes
            of filmmaking.</p>
        <p>The one-reeler Making a Living marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin
            strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as "a comedian of the first water".</p>
        <p>The film was Mabel's Strange Predicament, but "the Tramp" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences
            in Kid Auto Races at Venice – shot later than Mabel's Strange Predicament but released two days earlier on 7
            February 1914.[73][74] Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions
            for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors.</p>

        <h3>1918–1922: First National</h3>
        <p>In January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted
            in a short film together.</p>
        <p>Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his
            aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations,
            Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business
            manager, told the press: "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing
            [films] the way he wants ... It is quality, not quantity, we are after."</p>

            alt="charliechaplin4">
        <p>A Dog's Life, released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his
            increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of Pierrot".[129] The
            film was described by Louis Delluc as "cinema's first total work of art".[130] Chaplin then embarked on the
            Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the
            First World War.</p>
